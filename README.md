# Welcome to my portfolio 🥳

Recent graduate from BYU-Idaho with a degree in Cloud Computing. <b>Ready for what's coming next.</b>

## Always trying to be better 💪

Most of my projects were part of my learning at BYU-Idaho, but there are a lot of personal projects I want to show off as well.

### Personal Projects 🤓

- [Personal Website](https://jishrami.com) - Hosted on AWS, but versioned and deployed here on Github. This is my personal website that shows off my skills related to web and cloud development. Here is a link to [the repo](https://github.com/jishrami/jishplz)

- [Eyesite](https://github.com/Eye-Site) - A collaborative project that was made in 24 hours for a Hackathon in October of 2024. The wiki page, although not published, has the information about what the project entailed

### Other Projects 👀

- [Project Salus](https://github.com/emilie134340/salus) - Proudly contributed to an app that is meant to help with mental health and recovery. Most of the frontend was done by me

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jishrami) - A few front-end practice pens that I have worked on

- Help expand this list, [contact me](#contact-me)!
